### Project Description

The project is a server-based auction system where clients can participate in real-time auctions hosted on the server. The system handles multiple auctions and allows clients to interact with the server to place bids and monitor auction activities.

### Features

1. **Auction Initialization**:
   - An auction is created by entering the item's details and the starting price into the server.

2. **Client Participation**:
   - Clients connect to the server and select the auction they are interested in.

3. **Real-Time Bidding**:
   - Once an auction starts, clients can submit their bids in real-time.
   - The server receives the bid amount along with the clientâ€™s information.

4. **Timeout Handling**:
   - If no new bids are submitted within 10 seconds, the server sends a warning message to all connected clients, notifying them that the auction will close if no further bids are placed within the next 10 seconds.

5. **Auction Closure**:
   - The auction ends when no new bids are received within the allotted time. The server declares the highest bidder as the winner and finalizes the auction.

This system creates an interactive and dynamic auction environment where clients can actively participate, and the server ensures fair handling of bids and smooth operation of the auction process.
